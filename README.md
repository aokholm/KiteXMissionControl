# KiteXMissionControl
Node.js WebSocket server and logging

This is the main WebSocketServer that passes the relevant data between clients:
- iPhone for camera tracking of kite
- Webinterface for overview and control
- Motor controller

Additionally it also takes care of the logging and will in future versions also be the place for the Autopilot.
